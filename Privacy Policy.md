Data We Collect
1. Usage Data (Analytics): We use a third-party analytics service, Firebase Analytics (a Google product), to understand how players interact with our game. This service may collect anonymous data such as: 
  1. Device information (e.g., device model, OS version) 
  2. Session information (e.g., how long you play) 
  3. In-game events (e.g., starting or completing a level, using an item) * Anonymized Player ID We use this data solely to improve the game's features, fix bugs, and enhance the overall player experience. 
2. Advertising Data: Our game uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use data to provide personalized ads. This can include your device's Advertising ID. You can opt-out of personalized advertising through your device's settings. 
3. Purchase Data: When you make an in-app purchase (e.g., buying gold or removing ads), the transaction is processed by the Google Play Store. We do not collect or store any of your personal financial information, such as credit card numbers. We only receive a confirmation from Google that a purchase has been completed. We encourage you to review Google Play's privacy policy. 
4. Locally Stored Data: The game saves your progress, such as unlocked levels, gold balance, and item inventory, directly on your device using PlayerPrefs. This data is not transmitted to us.
